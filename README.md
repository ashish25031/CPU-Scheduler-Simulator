The CPU Scheduler Simulator is a web-based application that allows users to simulate different CPU scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SJF (preemptive & non-preemptive), and Round Robin. Users can input process details, visualize execution results, and analyze performance metrics like Completion Time, Turnaround Time, and Waiting Time. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features an interactive UI with animations.
